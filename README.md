# ExpressJS-staticwebsite
    Here I created web server by using ExpressJS and implementing a static website using express.static( ) method.
Express JS is the framework of nodeJS , and nodeJS is the run-time-environment of JavaScript which let us use the JavaScript  to the server,
so here I am using the javaScript at the server and places the complete QRCode generator website to the port where this web APP is going to listen(8080)
here I uses the app.use method which added a new middleware.
